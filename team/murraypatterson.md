### Overview
Dr. Murray Patterson is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Georgia State University, where he is part of the Bioinformatics Cluster. His research focuses on computational biology, bioinformatics, and the development of algorithms for analyzing biological data, including genome rearrangements, cancer phylogenies, and haplotyping.

Since joining Georgia State University in 2020, Dr. Patterson has been actively involved in teaching and research. His work spans a wide range of topics, including the evolution of metabolic networks, cancer phylogenies, and the development of efficient algorithms for high-throughput sequencing data.

### Research Interests
- **Genome Rearrangements**: Developing algorithms to model and analyze evolutionary processes that lead to changes in genome structure.
- **Cancer Phylogenies**: Inferring the evolutionary history of tumors using single-cell sequencing data.
- **Haplotyping**: Reconstructing haplotypes from sequencing data to understand genetic variation.
- **Metabolic Network Evolution**: Studying the evolution of metabolic networks from the perspective of enzymes and network structure.

### Teaching
Dr. Patterson has taught a variety of courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, including:
- **Artificial Intelligence** (Spring 2023)
- **Programming Language Concepts** (Fall 2022, Spring 2022, Spring 2021, Fall 2020)
